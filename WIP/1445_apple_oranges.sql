Table: Sales

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| sale_date     | date    |
| fruit         | enum    | 
| sold_num      | int     | 
+---------------+---------+
(sale_date, fruit) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the sales of "apples" and "oranges" sold each day.
 

Write an SQL query to report the difference between the number of apples and oranges sold each day.

Return the result table ordered by sale_date.

The query result format is in the following example.

SELECT sale_date, (apples_count - oranges_count) AS diff 
FROM (SELECT sale_date, CASE WHEN fruit='apples' THEN SUM(sold_num) ELSE 0 END apples_count, CASE WHEN fruit='oranges' THEN SUM(sold_num) ELSE 0 END oranges_count 
FROM Sales 
GROUP BY sale_date) sales_group

Example 1:

Input: 
Sales table:
+------------+------------+-------------+
| sale_date  | fruit      | sold_num    |
+------------+------------+-------------+
| 2020-05-01 | apples     | 10          |
| 2020-05-01 | oranges    | 8           |
| 2020-05-02 | apples     | 15          |
| 2020-05-02 | oranges    | 15          |
| 2020-05-03 | apples     | 20          |
| 2020-05-03 | oranges    | 0           |
| 2020-05-04 | apples     | 15          |
| 2020-05-04 | oranges    | 16          |
+------------+------------+-------------+
Output: 
+------------+--------------+
| sale_date  | diff         |
+------------+--------------+
| 2020-05-01 | 2            |
| 2020-05-02 | 0            |
| 2020-05-03 | 20           |
| 2020-05-04 | -1           |
+------------+--------------+
Explanation: 
Day 2020-05-01, 10 apples and 8 oranges were sold (Difference  10 - 8 = 2).
Day 2020-05-02, 15 apples and 15 oranges were sold (Difference 15 - 15 = 0).
Day 2020-05-03, 20 apples and 0 oranges were sold (Difference 20 - 0 = 20).
Day 2020-05-04, 15 apples and 16 oranges were sold (Difference 15 - 16 = -1).


-- My Answer 
SELECT sale_date, SUM(sold_num) diff 
FROM 
(SELECT sale_date, fruit, CASE WHEN fruit='oranges' THEN sold_num*-1 ELSE sold_num END sold_num
FROM Sales) minus_table
GROUP BY sale_date

-- Alternative Answer 
SELECT sale_date, SUM(CASE WHEN fruit='oranges' THEN sold_num*-1 ELSE sold_num END) diff 
FROM Sales
GROUP BY sale_date

-- What I learned 
1) you can use CASE clause inside SUM
